# Crestron-Sonoff-iFan04

Allows integration of a Sonoff iFan04 that has been flashed with Tasmota firmware with a Crestron program.
After flashing, go to the devices web page and configure the device type as a Sonoff iFan03.
Note - This has not been tested with a iFan03 but I believe the code will work with that Sonoff device
as well as the iFan04
